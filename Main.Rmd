# Use of Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Behavior

First off, we need to obtain our data. That we will do in the following code snippet:

```{r setup}

require(caret)


if(!exists("pmltesting")){
  
  pmltesting <- read.csv("~/UNAM 2020-24/DATSCI/MachineLearning/pml-testing.csv")

}

if(!exists("pmltraining")){
  
  pmltraining <- read.csv("~/UNAM 2020-24/DATSCI/MachineLearning/pml-training.csv")

}
```



```{r cars}

```



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```
